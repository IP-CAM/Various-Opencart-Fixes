#  OCFix|Dir Access

## Description
This is a workaround to bypass OpenCart 3.x restriction to write files into some directoriies (the error message *The directory is not allowed to be written to!*) while installing extensions, it makes it possible to apply modifications to any files within the `catalog` directory.
