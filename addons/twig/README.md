# aux/twig

## Description
Twig has 'include' functions which worked well in the past versions. Since twig loader was changed to ArrayLoader from FileSystem Loader the twig 'include' functions stopped working. More details: [#8134](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/8134).  
Compatible with OpenCart 3.x versions from 3.0.3.5 and above.
